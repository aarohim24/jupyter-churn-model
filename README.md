# Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a customer will churn (i.e., stop using a service) using historical data and machine learning techniques. It aims to help businesses proactively identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies.

## About the Project

Customer churn is a significant issue for businesses, especially those operating on subscription models such as telecom providers, banks, and SaaS companies. This project builds predictive models to identify customers who are likely to leave, enabling timely and targeted intervention.

---

## Dataset

This project uses the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) or a similar dataset with the following features:

* Customer demographics: Gender, Age
* Account information: Tenure, Contract Type, Payment Method
* Services used: Internet Service, Phone Service, Streaming Services
* Charges: Monthly and Total Charges
* Target variable: Churn (Yes/No)

---

## Objectives

* Analyze and understand customer behavior leading to churn
* Develop a machine learning model to predict churn
* Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

---

## Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python 3
* **Libraries**:

  * Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Visualization)
  * Scikit-learn (Modeling and Evaluation)

---

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Scaling numerical features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Understanding churn distribution
   * Analyzing feature relationships

3. **Model Development**

   * Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   * Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
   * Cross-validation

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   * Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve

## Results

| Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
| ------------------- | -------- | --------- | ------ | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | 80.2%    | 78.4%     | 70.3%  | 74.1%    |
| Random Forest       | 85.1%    | 83.7%     | 79.8%  | 81.7%    |
| XGBoost (Optional)  | 86.4%    | 84.9%     | 81.1%  | 82.9%    |

The final model was selected based on a balance of precision and recall, indicating effective identification of churn risk.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

1. Place the dataset file as `churn_data.csv` in the project directory.
2. Run the script or Jupyter notebook to begin training and evaluation:

```bash
python churn_prediction.py
```

---

## Future Work

* Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or Streamlit
* Implement model interpretability using SHAP or LIME
* Collect and integrate user activity logs for better prediction
